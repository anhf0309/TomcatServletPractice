This lab guides you through the creation of a Java servlet. The instructions in this lab show
you how to write the servlet in IntelliJ and deploy it to the Tomcat web server.
The servlet that we create in this section simply generates a Web page that says “Hello
World!” This simple exercise will help you understand the basic structure of servlets, how to
develop them while using IntelliJ, and how to deploy them in Tomcat.
